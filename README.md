the minishell project is an important project in the 42 school curriculum that teaches students how to build a simple command-line interpreter,
similar to the Unix shell.

By completing the project, students will learn how to:

    Implement a command-line interface: The minishell project requires students to implement a simple command-line interface, 
    similar to the Unix shell. 
    This provides students with an understanding of how command-line interfaces work and how they can be used in programming.

    Understand how processes and signals work: The project involves creating child processes and handling signals, 
    which helps students develop an understanding of how processes and signals work in programming.

    Work with environment variables: The minishell project requires students to work with environment variables,
    which helps them understand how environment variables can be used to store configuration information and other data.

    Handle I/O redirection: The project involves handling I/O redirection, 
    which helps students develop an understanding of how input and output can be redirected in programming.

Completing the minishell project is a significant achievement for students in the 42 curriculum, as it 
demonstrates their ability to build a command-line interpreter and work with advanced programming concepts such as processes, 
signals, and I/O redirection. By completing the project successfully,
students will gain the skills,
and knowledge necessary to work on more advanced programming projects and tackle more complex programming challenges in the future.
